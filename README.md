<h1>Identity and Access Management using Neo4j Graph Database</h1>
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a critical component of enterprise security, providing the framework for managing user identities and controlling access to resources. README: IAM Implementation with Neo4j.
<br><br>
IAM is a critical component of any organization's security strategy. It allows you to manage the identities and access of users, devices, and applications within your organization. A graph database like Neo4j is well-suited to model IAM systems as it can efficiently represent complex relationships between different entities.
<br><br>
This project is a sample implementation of IAM using Neo4j. It demonstrates how to use Neo4j to model users, roles, permissions, and access control policies. The implementation includes the following components:<br>

<li>User management<br>
<li>Role management<br>
<li>Permission management<br>
<li>Access control policy management<br>
