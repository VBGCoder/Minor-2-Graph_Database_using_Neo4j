Introduction
IAM is a critical component of any organization's security strategy. It allows you to manage the identities and access of users, devices, and applications within your organization. A graph database like Neo4j is well-suited to model IAM systems as it can efficiently represent complex relationships between different entities.

This project is a sample implementation of IAM using Neo4j. It demonstrates how to use Neo4j to model users, roles, permissions, and access control policies. The implementation includes the following components:

User management
Role management
Permission management
Access control policy management

Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need the following:

Neo4j installed on your system
A basic understanding of Cypher query language
An understanding of IAM concepts and terminology
Installation
To install the IAM implementation with Neo4j, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open Neo4j Desktop.
Create a new project and a new database.
Open the Neo4j browser and execute the setup.cypher script to create the schema and sample data.
Setup
Before you can use the IAM implementation, you will need to configure it. Here's how:

Open the config.yml file in the project directory.
Update the values for Neo4j connection settings, such as host, port, username, and password.
Modify the sample data to suit your needs, or create your own data.
Usage
Once you have set up the IAM implementation with Neo4j, you can use it to manage users, roles, permissions, and access control policies. Here are some example queries you can run in the Neo4j browser:

Create a new user
CREATE (:User {id: "1234", name: "John Doe"})
Create a new role
CREATE (:Role {id: "5678", name: "Admin"})
Grant a role to a user
MATCH (u:User {id: "1234"}), (r:Role {id: "5678"})
CREATE (u)-[:HAS_ROLE]->(r)
Create a new permission
CREATE (:Permission {id: "7890", name: "Can Edit Documents"})
Grant a permission to a role
MATCH (p:Permission {id: "7890"}), (r:Role {id: "5678"})
CREATE (r)-[:HAS_PERMISSION]->(p)
Create an access control policy
MATCH (r:Role {id: "5678"}), (p:Permission {id: "7890"})
CREATE (r)-[:CAN_ACCESS]->(p)
You can also use Cypher queries to retrieve information about users, roles, permissions, and access control policies.
